# The Power Behind Real-Time Push Notifications Using Webhooks

This is a talk I gave at [Denver Startup
Week](http://www.meetup.com/Denver-rb/events/223008791/) on September 29,
2015.

I wrote the talk in Markdown, and it's in the `index.md` file in this folder.
I then used
[markdown_to_reveal](https://github.com/kyletolle/markdown_to_reveal) to
convert it into a [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)
presentation. You can view the [final
presentation](http://kyletolle.github.io/dsw_webhooks_talk/) online. The
code is also available at
[dsw_webhooks_talk](https://github.com/kyletolle/dsw_webhooks_talk).

The images referenced in the Markdown actually live in the presentation repo,
so those images aren't in here.
