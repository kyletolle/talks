# Ruby Webhooks Intro

This is a talk I gave to
[Denver.rb](http://www.meetup.com/Denver-rb/events/223008791/) on June 9,
2015.

I wrote the talk in Markdown, and it's in the `index.md` file in this folder.
I then used
[markdown_to_reveal](https://github.com/kyletolle/markdown_to_reveal) to
convert it into a [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)
presentation. You can view the [final
presentation](https://kyletolle.github.io/ruby_webhooks_intro/) online. The
code is also available at
[ruby_webhooks_intro](https://github.com/kyletolle/ruby_webhooks_intro).

The images referenced in the Markdown actually live in the presentation repo,
so those images aren't in here.
