# Ruby Webhooks Intro

This is a talk I gave at
[Metis - Chicago](https://www.thisismetis.com/locations/chicago) on December 1,
2017.

I wrote the talk in Markdown, and it's in the `index.md` file in this folder.
I then used
[markdown_to_reveal](https://github.com/kyletolle/markdown_to_reveal) to
convert it into a [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)
presentation. You can view the [final
presentation](https://kyletolle.github.io/databases_and_developers/) online. The
code is also available at
[databases_and_developers](https://github.com/kyletolle/databases_and_developers).

The images referenced in the Markdown actually live in the presentation repo,
so those images aren't in here.
